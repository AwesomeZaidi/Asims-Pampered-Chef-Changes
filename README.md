# Asims Pampered Chef Changes 🎯

Independently making some of my own changes to the Pampered Chef website product you can find at www.pamperedchef.com. These changes are not affiliated with the company in any way. Again, all of the assets and wording within this project were borrowed from the real Tegus website, I do not own them.

I decided to make changes on mobile as I believe that is where most users might be coming from and where I thought I could add most value in this amonut of time invested.
